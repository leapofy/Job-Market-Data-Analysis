![Dashboard Overview](images/Screenshot 2025-07-07 at 2.47.37â€¯PM.png)
### Project Summary

This project explores real-world job market data for a fictional recruitment company called **DataSearch**, with the goal of uncovering key hiring trends in data roles. Using **SQL**, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis to understand salary patterns, in-demand skills, job titles, and experience requirements across industries and regions. The insights were visualized using **Tableau** through interactive dashboards and dynamic charts.

### Tableau Visualizations

Using Tableau Public, I built interactive dashboards to answer questions like:

* What are the most in-demand job titles?
* Which industries are hiring the most applicants?
* How does salary vary by experience and role?
* What skills are commonly required in data roles?

Visualizations include:

* Packed bubbles for job title frequency
* Line chart for salary vs. experience
* Area chart for job postings over time
* box_and_whisker plot for avg years of experience per industry
* A filterable dashboard by role and level of experience
